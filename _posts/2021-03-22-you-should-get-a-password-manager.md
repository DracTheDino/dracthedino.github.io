53% of people on the internet rely on their memory to manage passwords. 51% of people use the same password for both work and personal accounts. 57% of people who have been scammed in phishing attacks still haven't changed their passwords. All this data is from [https://dataprot.net/statistics/password-statistics/](https://dataprot.net/statistics/password-statistics/) if you want to read more about it.

Excuse my rather crude attempt at writing a title but my statement holds; you should get a password manager if you don't have one already. First of all, why use your memory as a password manager when you can get a computer program to do so for you? Second, with a password manager you have the choice to use a different password for every single website so even if one password is released in a hacker forum of sorts, you don't have to worry about changing your password elsewhere! That was in fact one of the reasons I chose to use a password manager. One of my very common passwords was released to the public thanks to a security breach on a website which will not be named. You have no idea how much time I spent looking at my mail history and slowly and painfully changing my password for every website.

At that time I was very active in a programming Discord online (and I still am) and decided to tell my story to them and they rightfully recommended that I use a password manager. After a few minutes of googling around I found a bunch of password managers — LastPass, 1Password, Keeper, Bitwarden, Dashlane, etc. — now the question was which password manager to use? And honestly you can use any of them, they are all pretty good but when I asked around, there was clear consensus that people LOVED Bitwarden; there were of course people who use LastPass, 1Password and others, but Bitwarden had a clearly happy userbase and I am currently part of it!

I found it super simple to add my existing accounts to Bitwarden and even randomly generating a password. It's a really feature packed software which is probably also one of my main complaints (?), in the sense that there is so much possibility with Bitwarden that a newbie to it can get super intimidated. Or maybe that was just me after a long day of changing passwords — who can tell?

All in all, I'm super happy with Bitwarden. Gone are the days where I had to remember the passwords in my brain and in come the days where you freaking forget your master password and rage quit on the internet! Seriously guys, remember your master password.

Thanks for reading, have a good day. Cheers.
